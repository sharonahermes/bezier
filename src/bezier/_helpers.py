    where :math:`\varepsilon = 2^{-40} \approx 10^{-12}` is a fixed

    the zero vector (i.e. when :math:`\min(s_1, s_2) = 0`) instead
    checks that the other vector is close enough to zero:

       This function assumes that both vectors have finite values,
       i.e. that no NaN or infinite numbers occur. NumPy provides
       :func:`np.allclose` for coverage of **all** cases.
